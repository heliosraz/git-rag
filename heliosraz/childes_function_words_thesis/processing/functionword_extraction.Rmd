# Loading Data from Childes-DB

We use the package `r childesr` to access the data in the CHILDES database. The code below downloads and stores all utterances by children and parents. Utterances are annotated for the type of sentence (declarative, interrogative, imperative).

```{r ChildesDBimports}
#Getting data from 1270 children in 73 corpora...
all_english_tokens <- get_tokens(collection = c("Eng-NA","Eng-UK"), 
                          role = c("target_child","Mother", "Father"),
                          token = "*")

#Import all English utterances from CHILDES 
eng_utterances <- get_utterances(collection = c("Eng-NA","Eng-UK"), 
                                 role = c("target_child","Mother", "Father"))

# Import statistics on the speakers in CHILDES
speaker_stats <- get_speaker_statistics(collection = c("Eng-NA","Eng-UK"), 
                                        role = c("target_child","Mother", "Father"))

```

# Token Processing

## Exclusions

The following script cleans up the data to exclude: unintelligible tokens and tokens above 72 months of the child's age. All exclusions are stored in a file called exclusions.csv

```{r exclusionsTokens}
# count the tokens before exclusions
initial <- nrow(all_english_tokens)

# number of children before exclusions
n_chi_initial <-
  all_english_tokens$target_child_id %>% unique() %>% length()

# remove the unintelligible tokens
english_tokens <- 
  all_english_tokens %>% 
  filter(gloss!="xxx", gloss!="xx", gloss!="yyy", gloss!="www", gloss!="zzz")

# count the tokens after excluding unintelligible ones
unintels <- nrow(english_tokens)

# number of children after excluding unintelligible tokens
n_chi_unintels <-
  english_tokens$target_child_id %>% unique() %>% length()

# remove NAs target_child_age
english_tokens <- 
  english_tokens %>% drop_na(target_child_age)

# count the tokens after removing NA tokens
nas <- nrow(english_tokens)

# number of children after excluding NAs
n_chi_nas <-
  english_tokens$target_child_id %>% unique() %>% length()

#Take out data for the age range above 6 years
english_tokens <-
  english_tokens %>%
  filter(target_child_age < 72)

# count the tokens after excluding the below 1 and older than 6 age range
age_ex <- nrow(english_tokens)

# number of children left after exclusions
n_chi_age <-
  english_tokens$target_child_id %>% unique() %>% length()

# record the dataframe of exclusions
exclusions <-
  data.frame (
    initial = initial,
    after_unintels = unintels,
    after_nas = nas,
    after_age = age_ex,
    unintelligible = initial - unintels,
    missing = unintels - nas,
    age = nas - age_ex,
    n_chi_total = n_chi_initial,
    n_chi_unintels = n_chi_unintels,
    n_chi_nas = n_chi_nas,
    n_chi_age = n_chi_age)
```

```{r savingData}
# save the exclusion data in a file as well as the final data
write_csv(exclusions, "../raw_data/token_exclusions.csv")
write_feather(english_tokens, "../raw_data/english_tokens.feather")
#write_csv(speaker_stats, "../raw_data/speaker_stats.csv")
```

## Coding Speaker Roles

Here we group mothers and fathers together as "parents".

```{r}
# Collapse mothers and fathers into parents
english_tokens$speaker <- "parent"
english_tokens$speaker[english_tokens$speaker_role=="Target_Child"] <- "child"
```

## Coding Age

Here we bin the age data per month.

```{r age}
english_tokens$age <- english_tokens$target_child_age %>% floor()
```

## Grouping Utterance Types

Grouping utterances as declarative, imperative, interrogative, and other.

```{r utterance_types}
# Prepare the utterance_type categories for this study based on the utterance_types in childes-db
## Categories: declarative, impertaive, interrogative, and other
english_tokens$utterance_type <-
  recode(english_tokens$utterance_type, 
         question = "interrogative",
         `broken for coding`="other",
          `imperative_emphatic` = "imperative",
         interruption = "other",
         `interruption question` = "interrogative",
         `missing CA terminator` = "other",
         `no break TCU continuation` = "other",
         `question exclamation` = "interrogative",
         `quotation next line` = "other",
         `quotation precedes` = "other",
         `self interruption` = "other",
         `self interruption question` = "interrogative",
         `trail off` = "other",
         `trail off question` = "interrogative"
         )

```

## Coding for function words

First we should make sure all words are in lower case:

```{r lowerCase}
english_tokens$gloss <- english_tokens$gloss %>% tolower()
```

Then we create a word column that marks all words as "other". Then we mark the function words of interest.

```{r NegationWords}
english_tokens$word <- "Other"

function_words <- c("no", "not", "cannot", "ain't", "isn't", "amn't", "aren't", "wasn't", "weren't", "don't", "doesn't", "didn't", "won't", "shan't", "hasn't", "haven't", "hadn't", "shouldn't", "can't", "couldn't", "mayn't", "mightn't", "wouldn't", "mustn't", "and", "or", "if", "nor", "therefore", "none", "some", "each", "every", "all", "most", "few", "many", "several", "few", "both", "everyone", "someone", "somebody", "everybody", "nonone", "everything", "something", "nowhere", "somewhere", "everywhere", "more", "less", "much", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth", "seventh", "eighth", "nineth", "tenth", "last", "can", "could", "need", "may", "might", "should", "ought", "must", "maybe", "perhaps", "shall", "any", "anyone", "anything", "anywhere", "anything", "anyway", "anyways", "ever", "yet", "the", "a", "an", "this", "that", "these", "those", "always", "usually", "seldom", "never", "sometimes", "often", "once", "twice", "when", "while", "after", "before", "then", "until", "since", "whenever", "during", "who", "when", "what", "whose", "where", "how", "why", "whom", "on", "in", "out", "up", "down", "under", "above", "below", "along", "over", "behind", "across", "beside", "between", "beyond", "inside", "outside", "into", "near", "onto", "toward", "because", "therefore", "but", "although", "again", "too", "also", "another", "other", "others", "still", "even", "only", "indeed", "either", "neither", "whether", "as", "else", "almost", "already", "except", "for", "from", "instead", "same", "different", "such", "with", "without", "about", "by", "very", "unless")

for (x in function_words){
  english_tokens$word[english_tokens$gloss==x] <- x
}
```

# Function Words of Interest

Next we need to create the categories of function words we are interested in:

* Logical Connectives: no, not, n't, and, or, if, nor
* Quantifiers: none, some, each, every, all, most, few, many, several, a few, both, everyone, someone, somebody, everybody, nonone, everything, something, nowhere, somewhere, everywhere
* Comparative Quantity: more, less, much
* Numerals: 1. numbers: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten 2. ordinals: first, second, third, fourth fifth, last
* Modals: can, could, need, may, might, should, ought, must, maybe, perhaps, shall
* Negative Polarity Items: any, anyone, anything, anyhow, anywhere, anything, anyway, ever, yet
* Definiteness and Demonstratives: 1. Definite: the, a, an 2. Demonstratives: this, that, these, those
* Temporals: 1. Quantifiers: always, usually, seldom, never, sometimes, now, often, once 2. Connectives: when, while, after, before, then, until, since, whenever, during
* Interrogatives: who, when, what, whose, where, how, why, whom
* Locatives: on, in, out, up, down, under, above, below, along, over, behind, across, beside, between, beyond, inside, outside, into, near, onto, toward
* Causal Connectives: because, therefore
* Contrast Connectives: but, although
* Additives: again, too, also, another, other, others, still
* Focus Particles: even, only, indeed
* Other: either, neither, whether as, else, almost, already, except, for, from, instead, same, different, such, with, without, about, by, very

First we start with marking content words and selecting logical connectives:
